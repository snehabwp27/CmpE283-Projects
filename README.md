Projects completed as a part of course work for CmpE283-Virtualization Technologies

Project 1: Availability Manager CmpE283 Virtualization Technologies

This is a Disaster recovery system that provides a solution to manage the virtual machines in a virtual infrastructure in case of a failure event.
Also it adds the virual hosts and virtual machines when these machines fail using snapshot recovery mechanism. It also performs cold migration
of the virtual machines when the virtual hosts goes down.

Project 2: Statistics Gathering and Monitor VMs CmpE283 Virtualization Technologies

This projects aims at collecting the logs for all the virtual hosts and virtual machines in a virtual infrastructure. It also aggregrates
the data, purges it and archieves it in MongoLab. The data is then exported from MongoLab to MySql. The data from MySql is given as an input 
to Google charts which generates dynamic charts for every 5 minutes of incoming data.
